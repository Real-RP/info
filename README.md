# info
 It helps newcomers to know what they should do first.
 
 I made this for newcomers to your server. It will help them to know your Teamspeak
 and informations like "what is Roleplay" etc.
 
 I know that this is not difficult to script! that't nothing what I need to get as feedback.
 thanks and have a nice day! :)

# how it works

you can set every message in the config.lua file.
do not change anything in the server.lua if you don't want to add more commands.
there is a template at the bottom, how to make a new command, just copy and paste
it for new commands.

**that's everything, like I said, this is not a "difficult" script or something like that**

take a :hamburger: 
:D
